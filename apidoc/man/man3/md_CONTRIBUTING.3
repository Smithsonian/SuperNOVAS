md_CONTRIBUTING \- Contributing to SuperNOVAS 
The \fISuperNOVAS\fP library is for everyone\&. While I, Attila Kovacs, am the maintainer of this library at the Smithsonian, I absolutely rely on developers like you to make it better\&. Whether there is a nagging issue you would like to fix, or a new feature you'd like to see, you can make a difference yourself\&. I very much encourage you to make this project a little bit your own, by submitting pull requests with fixes and enhancement\&. When you are ready, here are the typical steps for contributing to the project:
.PP
.IP "1." 4
Old or new \fBIssue\fP? Whether you just found a bug, or you are missing a much needed feature, start by checking open (and closed) \fCIssues\fP\&. If an existing issue seems like a good match to yours, feel free to speak up, comment, or to offer help in resolving it\&. If you find no issues that match, go ahead and create a new one\&.
.IP "2." 4
\fBFork\fP\&. Is it something you'd like to help resolve? Great! You should start by creating your own fork of the repository so you can work freely on your solution\&. I recommend that you place your work on a branch of your fork, which is named either after the issue number, e\&.g\&. \fCissue-192\fP, or some other descriptive name, such as \fCfast-nutations\fP\&.
.IP "3." 4
\fBDevelop\fP\&. Experiment on your fork/branch freely\&. If you run into a dead-end, you can always abandon it (which is why branches are great) and start anew\&. You can run your own tests locally using \fCmake test\fP before committing your changes\&. If the tests pass, you should also try running \fCmake all\fP and to ensure that all components of the package and its API documentation are also in order\&. Remember to synchronize your \fCmaster\fP branch by fetching changes from upstream every once in a while, and merging them into your development branch\&. Don't forget to:
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Add \fBdoxygen\fP markup your new code\&. You can keep it sweet and simple, but make sure it properly explains your globally exposed functions, their arguments and return values\&. You should also cross-reference other functions / constants that are similar, related, or relevant to what you just added\&.
.IP "  \(bu" 4
Add \fBUnit Tests\fP\&. Make sure your new code has as close to full unit test coverage as possible\&. You can add tests to \fCtest/src/test\&.c\fP as appropriate, and if you add new source files, you may need to adjust \fCtest/Makefile\fP so that \fCgcov\fP coverage is generated for your new source files\&. You should aim for 100% diff coverage\&. When pushing changes to your fork, you can get a coverage report by checking the Github Actions result of your commit (click the Coveralls link), and you can analyze what line(s) of code need to have tests added\&. Try to create tests that are simple but meaningful (i\&.e\&. check for valid results, rather than just confirm existing behavior), and try to cover as many realistic scenarios as appropriate\&. Write lots of tests if you need to\&.
.PP

.IP "4." 4
\fBPull Request\fP\&. Once you feel your work can be integrated, create a pull request from your fork/branch\&. You can do that easily from the github page of your fork/branch directly\&. In the pull request, provide a concise description of what you added or changed\&. Your pull request will be reviewed\&. You may get some feedback at this point, and maybe there will be discussions about possible improvements or regressions etc\&. It's a good thing too, and your changes will likely end up with added polish as a result\&. You can be all the more proud of it in the end!
.IP "5." 4
If all goes well, your pull-request will get merged, and will be included in the upcoming release of \fISuperNOVAS\fP\&. Congratulations for your excellent work, and many thanks for dedicating some of your time for making this library a little bit better\&. There will be many who will appreciate it\&. :-)

If at any point you have questions, or need feedback, don't be afraid to ask\&. You can put your questions into the issue you found or created, or your pull-request, or as a Q&A in \fCDiscussions\fP\&.
