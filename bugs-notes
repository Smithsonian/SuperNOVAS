ira_equinox (l. 8241-8244):

  if equinox = 1, but was 0 in the previous call with the same date and 
  accuracy, then it returns the last value (with eq_eq = 0) for equinox 0
  instead of calculating eq_eq via e_tilt() for a proper equinox = 1 result.


cio_basis 

  if only 'ra_cio' changed since last call, it returned the basis for the
  last calculation even if it was not for the same R.A.

ecl2equ_vec
equ2ecl_vec
geo_posvel
place
sidereal_time

  If accuracy changed but not the time, it returned the result for the
  other accuracy.
