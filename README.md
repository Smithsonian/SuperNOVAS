# SuperNOVAS 
The NOVAS C astrometry library, made better.

[SuperNOVAS](https://github.com/Smithsonian/SuperNOVAS/) is a positional astronomy library for the for the C 
programming language, providing high-precision astrometry such as one might need for running an observatory or a 
precise planetarium program. It is a fork of the Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software 
([NOVAS](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas_info)), with the aim of making it more user-friendly and 
easier to use overall.

SuperNOVAS is entirely free to use without any licensing restrictions.  Its source code is compatible with the C90 
standard, and hence should be suitable for many older platforms also. It is light-weight and easy to use, with full 
support for the IAU 2000/2006 standards for sub-microarcsecond position calculations.

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

SuperNOVAS is a fork of the The Naval Observatory Vector Astrometry Software 
([NOVAS](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas_info)). NOVAS is a light-weight but capable C library for precise 
positional astronomy calculations, such as one might need for an observatory, where apparent coordinates must be 
calculated to high precision. 

The primary goals of SuperNOVAS is to improve on the stock NOVAS C library by:

 - Fixing [outstanding issues](#fixed-issues)
 - Improving the ease of use by using `enum`s instead of integer constants, which also allows for some checking
   of use during compilations (such as using the incorrect `enum` type).
 - Improving [API documentation](https://smithsonian.github.io/SuperNOVAS.home/apidoc/html/) with 
   [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/) to provide browsable cross-referenced API docs. 
 - Streamlining calculations where possible to improve performance.
 - Adding `const` modifier to prototype arguments where appropriate
 - Checking arguments and setting `errno` as appropriate (and returning -1 unless another appropriate error code was 
   defined already) 
 - Adding [new features](#supernovas-features) to facilitate more accessible use
 - Providing a GNU `Makefile` to build static and shared libraries from sources easily on POSIX platforms
   (including for MacOS X, Cygwin, or WSL). (At this point we do not provide a similar native build setup for Windows, 
   but speak up if you would like to add it yourself!)
 - Adding regression testing and continuous integration on GitHub.
 
At the same time, SuperNOVAS aims to be fully backward compatible with the upstream NOVAS C library, such that it can 
be used as a drop-in, _link-time_ replacement for NOVAS in your application without having to change existing code you 
may have written for NOVAS C.
 
SuperNOVAS is currently based on NOVAS C version 3.1. We plan to rebase SuperNOVAS to the latest upstream release of 
the NOVAS C library, if new releases become available.
 
SuperNOVAS is maintained by Attila Kovacs at the Center for Astrophysics \| Harvard & Smithsonian, and it is 
available through the [Smithsonian/SuperNOVAS](https://github.com/Smithsonian/SuperNOVAS) repository on GitHub.

Outside contributions are very welcome. See
[how you can contribute](https://github.com/Smithsonian/SuperNOVAS/CONTRIBUTING.md) to make SuperNOVAS even better.

<a name="compatibility"></a>
## Compatibility with NOVAS C 3.1

SuperNOVAS strives to maintain API compatibility with the upstream NOVAS C 3.1 library, but not binary 
compatibility. In practical terms it means that you cannot simply drop-in replace your compiled objects (e.g. 
`novas.o`), or the static (e.g. `novas.a`) or shared (e.g. `novas.so`) libraries, from NOVAS C 3.1 with that from 
SuperNOVAS. Instead, you will need to (re)compile and or (re)link your application with the SuperNOVAS versions of 
these. 

This is because some function signatures have changed, e.g. to use an `enum` argument instead of the nondescript 
`short int` argument of NOVAS C 3.1, or because we added a return value to a function that was declared `void` 
in NOVAS C 3.1. We also changed the `object` structure to contain a `long` ID number instead of `short` to 
accommodate JPL NAIF codes, and for which 16-bit storage is insufficient. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="fixed-issues"></a>
## Fixed NOVAS C 3.1 issues

The SuperNOVAS library fixes a number of outstanding issues with NOVAS C 3.1. Here is a list of issues and fixes 
provided by SuperNOVAS over the upstream NOVAS C 3.1 code:

 - Fixes the [sidereal_time bug](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas_faq), whereby the `sidereal_time()` 
   function had an incorrect unit cast. This is a known issue of NOVAS C 3.1.
   
 - Fixes the [ephem_close bug](https://aa.usno.navy.mil/software/novas_faq), whereby `ephem_close()` in 
   `ephem_manager.c` did not reset the `EPHFILE` pointer to NULL. This is a known issue of NOVAS C 3.1.
   
 - Fixes antedating velocities and distances for light travel time in `ephemeris()`. When getting positions and 
   velocities for Solar-system sources, it is important to use the values from the time light originated from the 
   observed body rather than at the time that light arrives to the observer. This correction was done properly for 
   positions, but not for velocities or distances, resulting in incorrect observed radial velocities or apparent 
   distances being reported for spectroscopic observations or for angular-physical size conversions. 
   
 - Fixes bug in `ira_equinox()` which may return the result for the wrong type of equinox (mean vs. true) if the the 
   `equinox` argument was changing from 1 to 0, and back to 1 again with the date being held the same. This affected 
   routines downstream also, such as `sidereal_time()`.
   
 - Fixes accuracy switching bug in `cio_basis()`, `cio_location()`, `ecl2equ`, `equ2ecl_vec()`, `ecl2equ_vec()`, 
   `geo_posvel()`,  `place()`, and `sidereal_time()`. All these functions returned a cached value for the other 
   accuracy if the other input parameters are the same as a prior call, except the accuracy. 
   
 - Fixes multiple bugs related to using cached values in `cio_basis()` with alternating CIO location reference 
   systems.
   
 - Fix bug in `equ2ecl_vec()` and `ecl2equ_vec()` whereby a query with `coord_sys = 2` (GCRS) has overwritten the
   cached mean obliquity value for `coord_sys = 0` (mean equinox of date). As a result, a subsequent call with
   `coord_sys = 0` and the same date as before would return the results GCRS coordinates instead of the
   requested mean equinox of date coordinates.
  
 - The use of `fmod()` in NOVAS C 3.1 led to the wrong results when the numerator was negative and the result was
   not turned into a proper remainder. This affected the calculation of the mean anomaly in `solsys3.c` (line 261)
   and the fundamental arguments calculated in `fund_args()` and `ee_ct()` for dates prior to J2000. Less 
   critically, it also was the reason `cal_date()` did not work for negative JD values.
   
 - Fixes `aberration()` returning NAN vectors if the `ve` argument is 0. It now returns the unmodified input
   vector appropriately instead.
   
 - Fixes potential string overflows and eliminates associated compiler warnings.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<a name="installation"></a>
## Building and installation


The SuperNOVAS distribution contains a `Makefile` for GNU make, which is suitable for compiling the library (as well as 
local documentation, and tests, etc.) on POSIX systems such as Linux, BSD, MacOS X, or Cygwin or WSL on Windows.

Before compiling the library take a look a `config.mk` and edit it as necessary for your needs, such as:

 - Choose which planet calculator function routines are built into the library (for example to provide 
   `earth_sun_calc()` set `BUILTIN_SOLSYS3 = 1`  and/or for `planet_ephem_provider()` set `BUILTIN_SOLSYS_EPHEM = 1`. 
   You can then specify these functions as the default planet calculator for `ephemeris()` in your application 
   dynamically via `set_planet_provider()`.
   
 - Choose which stock planetary calculator module (if any) should provide a default `solarsystem()` implementation for 
   `ephemeris()` calls by setting `DEFAULT_SOLSYS` to 1 -- 3 for `solsys1.c` trough `solsys3.c`, respectively. If you 
   want to link your own `solarsystem()` implementation(s) against the library, you should not set `DEFAULT_SOLSYS` 
   (i.e. delete or comment out the corresponding line or else set `DEFAULT_SOLSYS` to 0).
   
 - If you are going to be using the functions of `solsys1.c` you may also want to specify the source file that will 
   provide the `readeph()` implementation for it by setting `DEFAULT_READEPH` appropriately. (The default setting uses 
   the dummy `readeph0.c` which simply returns an error if one tries to use the functions from `solsys1.c`.

 - If you want ot use the CIO locator binary file for `cio_location()`, you can specify the path to the binary file 
   (e.g. `/usr/local/share/novas/cio_ra.bin`) where the file will be located at on your system. (The CIO locator file 
   is not at all necessary for the functioning of the library, unless you specifically require CIO poistions relative 
   to GCRS.)

Now you are ready to build the library:

```bash
  $ make
```

will compile the static (`lib/novas.a`) and shared (`lib/novas.so`) libraries, produce a CIO locator data file 
(`tools/data/cio_ra.bin`), and compile the API documentation (into `apidoc/`) using `doxygen`. Alternatively, you can 
build select components of the above with the `make` targets `static`, `shared`, `cio_file`, and `dox` respectively.

After building the library you can install the above components to the desired locations on your system. For a 
system-wide install you may place the static or shared library into `/usr/loval/lib/`, copy the CIO locator file to 
the place you specified in `config.mk` etc. You may also want to copy the header files in `include/` to e.g. 
`/usr/local/include` so you can compile your application against SuperNOVAS easily on your system.


<a name="building-your-application"></a>
## Building your application with SuperNOVAS

Provided you have installed the SuperNOVAS headers into a standard location (such as `/usr/include` or 
`/usr/local/include`) and the static or shared library into `usr/lib` (or `/usr/local/lib` or similar), you
can build your application against it very easily. For example, to build `myastroapp.c` against SuperNOVAS, 
you might have a `Makefile` with contents like:

```make
  myastroapp: myastroapp.c 
  	$(CC) -o $@ $(CFLAGS) $^ -lm -lnovas
```

If you have a legacy NOVAS C 3.1 application, it is possible that the compilation will give you errors due
to missing includes for `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `ctype.h` or `string.h`. This is because these were explicitly
included in `novas.h` in NOVAS C 3.1, but not in SuperNOVAS (at least not by default), as a matter of best
practice. If this is a problem for you can 'fix' it in one of two ways: (1) Add the missing `#include` 
directives to your application source explicitly, or if that's not an option for you, then (2) set the 
`-DCOMPAT=1` compiler flag when compiling your application:

```make
  myastroapp: myastroapp.c 
  	$(CC) -o $@ $(CFLAGS) -DCOMPAT=1 $^ -lm -lnovas
```

To use your own `solarsystem()` implemetation for `ephemeris()`, you will want to build the library with
`DEFAULT_SOLSYS` not set (or else set to 0) in `config.mk` (see section above), and your applications 
`Makefile` may contain something like:

```make
  myastroapp: myastroapp.c my_solsys.c 
  	$(CC) -o $@ $(CFLAGS) $^ -lm -lnovas
```

The same principle applies to using your specific `readeph()` implementation (only with `DEFAULT_READEPH` 
being unset in `config.mk`).

### Note on alternative methodologies

The IAU 2000 and 2006 resolutions have completely overhauled the system of astronomical coordinate transformations
to enable higher precision astrometry. (Super)NOVAS supports coordinate calculations both in the old (pre IAU 2000) 
ways, and in the new IAU standard method. Here is an overview of how the old and new methods define some of the
terms differently:

 | Concept                    | Old standard                  | New IAU standard                                  |
 | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
 | Catalog coordinate system  | J2000 or B1950                | International Celestial Reference System (ICRS)   |
 | Dynamical system           | True of Date (TOD)            | Celestial Intermediate Reference System (CIRS)    |
 | Dynamical R.A. origin      | true equinox of date          | Celestial Intermediate Origin (CIO)               |
 | Precession, nutation, bias | separate, no tidal terms      | IAU 2006 precession/nutation model                |
 | Celestial Pole offsets     | d&psi;, d&epsilon;            | _dx_, _dy_                                        |
 | Earth rotation measure     | Greenwich Sidereal Time (GST) | Earth Rotation Angle (ERA)                        |
 | Fixed Earth System         | WGS84                         | International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) |
 
See the various enums and constants defined in `novas.h`, as well as the descriptions on the various NOVAS routines
on how they are appropriate for the old and new methodologies respectively.

<a name="sidereal-example"></a>
### Calculating positions for a sidereal source

Sidereal sources may be anything beyond the solar-system with 'fixed' catalog coordinates. It may be a star, or a 
galactic molecular cloud, or a distant quasar. First, you must provide the coordinates (which may include proper 
motion and parallax). Let's assume we pick a star for which we have B1950 (i.e. FK4) coordinates:

```c
 cat_entry source; // Structure to contain information on sidereal source 

 // Let's assume we have B1950 (FK4) coordinates...
 // 16h26m20.1918s, -26d19m23.138s (B1950), proper motion -12.11, -23.30 mas/year, 
 // parallax 5.89 mas, radial velocity -3.4 km/s.
 make_cat_entry("Antares", "FK4", 1, 16.43894213, -26.323094, -12.11, -23.30, 5.89, -3.4, &source);
```

We must convert these coordinates to the now standard ICRS system for calculations in SuperNOVAS, first by calculating 
equivalent J2000 coordinates, by applying the proper motion and the appropriate precession. Then, we apply a small 
adjustment to convert from J2000 to ICRS coordinates.

```c
 // First change the catalog coordinates (in place) to the J2000 (FK5)... 
 transform_cat(CHANGE_EPOCH, NOVAS_B1950, &source, NOVAS_J2000, "FK5", &source);
  
 // Then convert J2000 coordinates to ICRS (also in place). Here the dates don't matter...
 transform_cat(CHANGE_J2000_TO_ICRS, 0.0, &source, 0.0, "ICRS", &source);
```

(Naturally, you can skip the transformation steps above if you have defined your source in ICRS coordinates from the 
start.)

Next, we define the location where we observe from. Here we can (but don't have to) specify local weather parameters
(temperature and pressure) also for refraction correction later (in this example, we'll skip the weather):

```c
 observer obs;	 // Structure to contain observer location 

 // Specify the location we are observing from
 // 50.7374 deg N, 7.0982 deg E, 60m elevation
 make_observer_on_surface(50.7374, 7.0982, 60.0, 0.0, 0.0, &obs);
```

We also need to set the time of observation. Our clocks usually measure UTC, but for NOVAS we usually need time 
measured based on Terrestrial Time (TT) or Barycentric Time (TDB) or UT1. Typically you will have to provide
NOVAS with the TT - UT1 time difference, which can be calculated from the current leap seconds and the UT1 - UTC 
time difference (a.k.a. DUT1): 

```c
 // The current value for the leap seconds (UTC - TAI)
 int leap_seconds = 37;

 // Set the DUT1 = UT1 - UTC time difference in seconds (e.g. from IERS Bulletins)
 int dut1 = ...

 // Calculate the Terrestrial Time (TT) based Julian date of observation (in days)
 // Let's say on 2024-02-06 at 14:53:06 UTC.
 double jd_tt = julian_date(2024, 2, 6, 14.885) + get_utc_to_tt(leap_seconds) / 86400.0; 
  
 // We'll also need the TT - UT1 difference, which we can obtain from what we already
 // defined above
 double ut1_to_tt = get_ut1_to_tt(jd_tt, dut1);
```

Next, you may want to set the small diurnal (sub-arcsec level) corrections to Earth orientation, which are published
in the [IERS Bulletins](https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/Bulletins/bulletins.html). The obvious utility of 
these values comes later, when converting positions from the celestial CIRS frame to the Earth-fixed ITRS frame. Less 
obviously, however, it is also needed for calculating the CIO location for CIRS coordinates when a CIO locator file 
is not available, or for calculations sidereal time measures etc. Therefore, it's best to set the pole offsets 
early on:

```c
 // Current polar offsets provided by the IERS Bulletins (in arcsec)
 double dx = ... 
 double dy = ...
  
 cel_pole(jd_tt, POLE_OFFSETS_X_Y, dx, dy);
```

Now we can calculate the precise apparent position (CIRS or TOD) of the source, such as it's right ascension (R.A.) 
and declination, and the equatorial _x,y,z_ unit vector pointing in the direction of the source (in the requested 
coordinate system and for the specified observing location). We also get radial velocity (for spectroscopy), and 
distance (e.g. for apparent-to-physical size conversion):

```c
 sky_pos pos;	// We'll return the observable positions (in CIRS) in this structure
  
 // Calculate the apparent (CIRS) topocentric positions for the above configuration
 int status = place_star(jd_tt, &source, &obs, ut1_to_tt, NOVAS_CIRS, NOVAS_FULL_ACCURACY, &pos);
  
 // You should always check that the calculation was successful...
 if(status) {
   // Ooops, something went wrong...
   return -1;
 }
```

Finally, we may want to calculate the astrometric azimuth and zenith distance (= 90&deg; - azimuth) angles of the 
source at the specified observing location (without refraction correction):

```c
 double itrs[3];  // ITRS position vector of source to populate
 double az, zd;   // [deg] local azimuth and zenith distance angles to populate
  
 // Convert CIRS to Earth-fixed ITRS using the pole offsets.
 cirs_to_itrs(jd_tt, 0.0, ut1_to_tt, NOVAS_FULL_ACCURACY, dx, dy, pos.r_hat, itrs);
 
 // Finally convert ITRS to local horizontal coordinates at the observing site
 itrs_to_hor(itrs, &obs.on_surface, &az, &zd);
``` 

In the example above we first calculated the apparent coordinates in the Celestial Intermediate Reference System 
(CIRS). Then we used `cirs_to_itrs()` function then convert first it to the Earth-fixed International Terrestrial 
Reference system (ITRS) using the small (arcsec-level) measured variation of the pole (dx, dy) provided explicitly 
since `cirs_to_itrs()` does not use the values previously set via `cel_pole()`. Finally, `itrs_to_hor()` converts 
the ITRS coordinates to the horizontal system at the observer location.

You can additionally apply an optical refraction correction for the astrometric (unrefracted) zenith angle, if you 
want, e.g.:

```c
   zd -= refract_astro(&obs.on_surf, NOVAS_STANDARD_ATMOSPHERE, zd);
```


<a name="solsys-example"></a>
### Calculating positions for a Solar-system source

Solar-system sources work similarly to the above with a few important differences.

First, You will have to provide one or more functions to obtain the barycentric ICRS positions for your Solar-system 
source(s) of interest for the specific Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) of observation. See section on integrating 
[External Solar-system ephemeris data or services](#solarsystem) with SuperNOVAS. You can specify the functions
that will handle the respective ephemeris data at runtime before making the NOVAS calls that need them, e.g.:

```c
 // Set the function to use for regular precision planet position calculations
 set_planet_provider(my_planet_function);
  
 // Set the function for high-precision planet position calculations
 set_planet_provider(my_very_precise_planet_function);
  
 // Set the function to use for calculating all sorts of solar-system bodies
 set_ephem_provider(my_ephemeris_provider_function);
```

You can use `tt2tdb()` to help convert Terrestrial Time (TT) to Barycentric Dynamic Time (TDB) for your ephemeris 
provider functions (they only differ when you really need extreme precision -- for most applications you can used TT 
and TDB interchangeably in the present era):

```c
 double jd_tdb = jd_tt + tt2tdb(jd_tt) / 86400.0;
```

Instead of `make_cat_entry` you define your source as an `object` with an ID number that is used by the ephemeris 
service you provided. For major planets you might want to use type `NOVAS_PLANET` if they use a 
`novas_planet_provider` function to access ephemeris data with their NOVAS IDs, or else `NOVAS_EPHEM_OBJECT` for 
more generic ephemeris handling via a user-provided `novas_ephem_provider`. E.g.:

```c
 object mars, ceres; // Hold data on solar-system bodies.
  
 // Mars will be handled by hte planet calculator function
 make_planet(NOVAS_MARS, &mars);
  
 // Ceres will be handled by the generic ephemeris reader, which say uses the 
 // NAIF ID of 2000001
 make_ephem_object("Ceres", 2000001, &ceres);
```

Other than that, it's the same spiel as before, except using the appropriate `place()` for generic celestial
targets instead of `place_star()` for the sidereal sources. E.g.:

```c
 int status = place(jd_tt, &mars, &obs, ut1_to_tt, NOVAS_CIRS, NOVAS_FULL_ACCURACY, &pos);
 if(status) {
   // Ooops, something went wrong...
   ...
 }
```


<a name="accuracy-notes"></a>
#### Reduced accuracy shortcuts

When one does not need positions at the microarcsecond level, some shortcuts can be made to the recipe above:

 - You can use `NOVAS_REDUCED_ACCURACY` instead of `NOVAS_FULL_ACCURACY` for the calculations. This typically has an 
   effect at the milliarcsecond level only, but may be much faster to calculate.
 - You can skip the J2000 to ICRS conversion and use J2000 coordinates directly as a fair approximation (at the 
   &lt;~ 22 mas level).
 - You might skip the pole offsets dx, dy. These are tenths of arcsec, typically.
 
<a name="performance-note"></a>
#### Performance considerations

Some of the calculations involved can be expensive from a computational perspective. For the most typical use case
however, NOVAS (and SuperNOVAS) has a trick up its sleeve: it caches the last result of intensive calculations so they 
may be re-used if the call is made with the same environmental parameters again (such as JD time and accuracy). 
Therefore, when calculating positions for a large number of sources at different times:

 - It is best to iterate over the sources while keeping the time fixed in the inner loop. 
 - You probably want to stick to one accuracy mode (`NOVAS_FULL_ACCURACY` or `NOVAS_REDUCED_ACCURACY`) to prevent
   re-calculating the same quantities repeatedly to alternating precision.
 - If super-high accuracy is not required `NOVAS_REDUCED_ACCURACY` mode offers much faster calculations, in general.

<a name="precision"></a>
## Notes on precision

The SuperNOVAS library is in principle capable of calculating positions to sub-microarcsecond, and velocities to mm/s 
precision for all types of celestial sources. However, there are certain prerequisites and practical considerations 
before that level of accuracy is reached.


 1. __IAU 2000/2006 conventions__: High precision calculations will generally require that you use SuperNOVAS with the
    new IAU standard quantities and methods. The old ways were simply not suited for precision much below the 
    milliarcsecond level.

 2. __Earth's polar motion__: Calculating precise positions for any Earth-based observations requires precise 
    knowledge of Earth orientation at the time of observation. The pole is subject to predictable precession and 
    nutation, but  also small irregular variations in the orientation of the rotational axis and the rotation period 
    (a.k.a polar wobble). The [IERS Bulletins](https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/Bulletins/bulletins.html) 
    provide up-to-date measurements, historical data, and near-term projections for the polar offsets and the UT1-UTC 
    (DUT1) time difference and leap-seconds (UTC-TAI). In SuperNOVAS you can use `cel_pole()` and `get_ut1_to_tt()` 
    functions to apply / use the published values from these to improve the astrometic precision of Earth-orientation
    based coordinate calculations. Without setting and using the actual polar offset values for the time of 
    observation, positions for Earth-based observations will be accurate at the arcsecond level only.
 
 3. __Solar-system sources__: Precise calculations for Solar-system sources requires precise ephemeris data for both
    the target object as well as for Earth, and the Sun vs the Solar-system barycenter. For the highest precision 
    calculations you also need positions for all major planets to calculate gravitational deflection precisely. By 
    default SuperNOVAS can only provide approximate positions for the Earth and Sun (see `earth_sun_calc()` in 
    `solsys3.c`), but certainly not at the sub-microarcsecond level, and not for other solar-system sources. You will 
    need to provide a way to interface SuperNOVAS with a suitable ephemeris source (such as the CSPICE toolkit from 
    JPL) if you want to use it to obtain precise positions for Solar-system bodies. See the 
    [section below](#solarsystem) for more information how you can do that.
    
  4. __Refraction__: Ground based observations are also subject to atmospheric refraction. SuperNOVAS offers the 
    option to include _optical_ refraction corrections in `equ2hor()` either for a standard atmosphere or more 
    precisely using the weather parameters defined in the `on_surface` data structure that specifies the observer 
    locations. Note, that refraction at radio wavelengths is notably different from the included optical model. In 
    either case you may want to skip the refraction corrections offered in this library, and instead implement your 
    own as appropriate (or not at all).
  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


<a name="supernovas-features"></a>
## SuperNOVAS specific features

 - SuperNOVAS functions take `enum`s as their option arguments instead of raw integers. These enums are defined in 
   `novas.h`. The same header also defines a number of useful constants. The enums allow for some compiler checking, 
   and make for more readable code that is easier to debug. They also make it easy to see what choices are available
   for each function argument, without having to consult the documentation each and every time.

 - All SuperNOVAS functions check for the basic validity of the supplied arguments (Such as NULL pointers or illegal 
   duplicate arguments) and will return -1 (with `errno` set, usually to `EINVAL`) if the arguments supplied are
   invalid (unless the NOVAS C API already defined a different return value for specific cases. If so, the NOVAS C
   error code is returned for compatibility).
   
 - All erroneous returns now set `errno` so that users can track the source of the error in the standard C way and
   use functions such as `perror()` ans `strerror()` to print human-readable error messages.
   
 - Many output values supplied via pointers are set to clearly invalid values in case of erroneous returns, such as
   `NAN` so that even if the caller forgets to check the error code, it becomes obvious that the values returned
   should not be used as if they were valid. (No more sneaky silent errors.)

 - Many SuperNOVAS functions allow `NULL` arguments, both for optional input values as well as outputs that are not 
   required. See the [API Documentation](https://smithsonian.github.io/SuperNOVAS.home/apidoc/html/) for specifics).
   This eliminates the need to declare dummy variables in your application code.

 - All SuperNOVAS functions that take an input vector to produce an output vector allow the output vector argument
   be the same as the input vector argument. For example, `frame_time(pos, J2000_TO_ICRS, pos)` using the same 
   `pos` vector both as the input and the output. In this case the `pos` vector is modified in place by the call. 
   This can greatly simplify usage, and eliminate extraneous declarations, when intermediates are not required.

 - SuperNOVAS prototypes declare function pointer arguments as `const` whenever the function does not modify the
   data content being pointed at. This supports better programming practices that generally aim to avoid unintended 
   data modifications.
   
 - Source names and catalog names can both be up to 64 bytes (including termination), up from 51 and 4 respectively
   NOVAS C, while keeping `struct` layouts the same thanks to alignment.
   
 - Runtime configuration:

   * The planet position calculator function used by `ephemeris` can be set at runtime via `set_planet_provider()`, and
     `set_planet_provider_hp` (for high precision calculations). Similarly, if `planet_ephem_provider()` or 
     `planet_ephem_provider_hp()` (defined in `solsys-ephem.c`) are set as the planet calculator functions, then 
     `set_ephem_provider()` can set the user-specified function to use with these to actually read ephemeris data
     (e.g. from a JPL ephemeris file).
 
   * If CIO locations vs GSRS are important to the user, the user may call `set_cio_locator_file()` at runtime to
     specify the location of the binary CIO interpolation table (e.g. `cio_ra.bin`) to use, even if the library was
     compiled with the different default CIO locator path. 
 
   * The default low-precision nutation calculator `nu2000k()` can be replaced by another suitable IAU 2006 nutation
     approximation via `set_nutation_lp_provider()`. For example, the user may want to use the `iau2000b()` model 
     or some custom algorithm instead.
 
 - New intuitive XYZ coordinate conversion functions:
   * for GCRS - CIRS - ITRS (IAU 2000 standard): `gcrs_to_cirs()`, `cirs_to_itrs()`, and `itrs_to_cirs()`, 
     `cirs_to_gcrs()`.
   * for GCRS - J2000 - TOD - ITRS (old methodology): `gcrs_to_j2000()`, `j2000_to_tod()`, `tod_to_itrs()`, and 
     `itrs_to_tod()`, `tod_to_j2000()`, `j2000_to_gcrs()`.

 - New `itrs_to_hor()` and `hor_to_itrs()` functions to convert Earth-fixed ITRS coordinates to astrometric azimuth 
   and elevation or back. Whereas `tod_to_itrs()` followed by `itrs_to_hor()` is effectively a just a more explicit 
   version of the existing `equ2hor()` for converting from TOD to to local horizontal (old methodology), the 
   `cirs_to_itrs()`  followed by `itrs_to_hor()` does the same from CIRS (new IAU standard methodology), and had no 
   equivalent in NOVAS C 3.1.
   
 - New `ecl2equ()` for converting ecliptic coordinates to equatorial, complementing existing `equ2ecl()`.
   
 - New `gal2equ()` for converting galactic coordinates to ICRS equatorial, complementing existing `equ2gal()`.
   
 - New `refract_astro()` function that complements the existing `refract()` but takes an unrefracted (astrometric) 
   zenith angle as its argument.

 - New convenience functions to wrap `place()` for simpler specific use: `place_star()`, `place_icrs()`, 
   `place_gcrs()`, `place_cirs()`, and `place_tod()`.
   
 - New `radec_star()` and `radec_planet()` methods as the common point for all existing methods such as `astro_star()`
   `local_star()`, `topo_planet()` etc.
 
 - New time conversion utilities `tt2tdb()` and `get_ut1_to_tt()` make it simpler to convert between UT1, TT, and TDB
   time scales, and to supply `ut1_to_tt` arguments to `place()` or topocentric calculations.
 
 - Co-existing `solarsystem()` variants. It is possible to use the different `solarsystem()` implementations 
   provided by `solsys1.c`, `solsys2.c`, `solsys3.c` and/or `solsys-ephem.c` side-by-side, as they define their
   functionalities with distinct, non-conflicting names, e.g. `earth_sun_calc()` vs `planet_jplint()` vs
   `planet_ephem_manager()` vs `planet_ephem_provider()`. See the section on 
   [Building and installation](#installation) further above on including a selection of these in your library 
   build.)

 - New `novas_case_sensitive(int)` method to enable (or disable) case-sensitive processing of object names. (By
   default NOVAS object names were converted to upper-case, making them effectively case-insensitive.)

 - New `make_planet()` and `make_ephem_object()` to make it simpler to configure Solar-system objects.
 
 - `cel2ter()` and `tel2cel()` can now process 'option'/'class' = 1 (`NOVAS_REFERENCE_CLASS`) regardless of the
   methodology (`EROT_ERA` or `EROT_GST`) used to input or output coordinates in GCRS.
 
 - Changed `make_object()` retains the specified number argument (which can be different from the `starnumber` value
   in the supplied `cat_entry` structure).
   
 - Changed the standard atmospheric model for (optical) refraction calculation to include a simple model for the 
   annual average temperature at the site (based on latitude and elevation). This results is a slightly more educated 
   guess of the actual refraction than the global fixed temperature of 10 &deg;C assumed by NOVAC C 3.1 regardless of 
   observing location.

<a name="solarsystem"></a>
## External Solar-system ephemeris data or services


If you want to use SuperNOVAS to calculate positions for a range of Solar-system objects, and/or to do it with 
sufficient precision, you will have to integrate it with a suitable provider of ephemeris data, such as JPL Horizons 
or the Minor Planet Center. Given the NOVAS C heritage, and some added SuperNOVAS flexibility in this area, you have 
several options on doing that. These are listed from the most flexible (and preferred) to the least flexible (old 
ways).

 1. [Universal ephemeris data / service integration](#universal-ephemerides)
 2. [Built-in support for (old) JPL major planet ephemerides](#builtin-ephem-readers)
 3. [Explicit linking of custom ephemeris functions](#explicit-ephem-linking)


<a name="universal-ephemerides"></a>
### 1. Universal ephemeris data / service integration 

Possibly the most universal way to integrate ephemeris data with SuperNOVAS is to write your own 
`novas_ephem_provider`, e.g.:

```c
 int my_ephem_reader(const char *name, long id, double jd_tdb_high, double jd_tdb_low, 
                     enum novas_origin *origin, double *pos, double *vel) {
   // Your custom ephemeris reader implementation here
   ...
 }
```

which takes an object ID number (such as a NAIF) an object name, and a split TDB date (for precision) as it inputs, 
and returns the type of origin with corresponding ICRS position and velocity vectors in the supplied poiter locations. 
The function can use either the ID number or the name to identify the object or file (whatever is the most appropriate 
for the implementation). The positions and velocities may be returned either relative to the SSB or relative to the 
heliocenter, and accordingly, your function should set the value pointed at by origin to `NOVAS_BARYCENTER` or 
`NOVAS_HELIOCENTER` accordingly. Positions and velocities are rectangular ICRS _x,y,z_ vectors in units of AU and 
AU/day respectively. 

This way you can easily integrate current ephemeris data for JPL Horizons, e.g. using the CSPICE toolkit, or for the 
Minor Planet Center (MPC), or whatever other ephemeris service you prefer.

Once you have your adapter function, you can set it as your ephemeris service via `set_ephem_provider()`:

```c
 set_ephem_provider(my_ephem_reader);
```

By default, your custom `my_ephem_reader` funtion will be used for 'minor planets' only (i.e. anything other than the 
major planets, the Sun, Moon, and the Solar System Barycenter). And, you can use the same function for the mentioned 
'major planets' also via:

```c
 set_planet_provider(planet_ephem_provider);
 set_planet_provider_hp(planet_ephem_provider_hp);
```

provided you compiled SuperNOVAS with `BUILTIN_SOLSYS_EPHEM = 1` (in `config.mk`), or else you link your code against
`solsys-ephem.c` explicitly. Easy-peasy.


<a name="builtin-ephem-readers"></a>
### 2. Built-in support for (old) JPL major planet ephemerides

If you only need support for major planets, you may be able to use one of the modules included in the SuperNOVAS
distribution. The modules `solsys1.c` and `solsys2.c` provide built-in support to older JPL ephemerides (DE200 to DE421), 
either via the `ephem_manager()` interface of `solsys1.c` or via the `jplint_()` interface of `solsys2.c`.

#### 2.1. Planets via `eph_manager`

To use the `eph_manager` interface for planet 1997 JPL planet ephemeris (DE200 through DE421), you must either build 
superNOVAS with `BUILTIN_SOLSYS1 = 1` in `config.mk`, or else link your application with `solsys1.c` and 
`ephem_manager.c` from SuperNOVAS explicitly. If you want `eph_manager` to be your default ephemeris provider (the old 
way) you might also want to set `DEFAULT_SOLSYS = 1` in `config.mk`. Otherwise, your application should set 
`eph_manager` as your planetary ephemeris provider at runtime via:

```c
 set_planet_provider(planet_eph_manager);
 set_planet_provider_hp(planet_eph_manager_hp);
```

Either way, before you can use the ephemeris, you must also open the relevant ephemeris data file with `ephem_open()`:

```c
 int de_number;	         // The DE number, e.g. 405 for DE405
 double from_jd, to_jd;  // [day] Julian date range of the ephemeris data
  
 ephem_open("path-to/de405.bsp", &from_jd, &to_jd, &de_number);
```

And, when you are done using the ephemeris file, you should close it with

```c
 ephem_close();
```
 
Note, that at any given time `eph_manager()` can have only one ephemeris data file opened. You cannot use it to 
retrieve data from multiple ephemeris input files at the same time. (But you can with the CSPICE toolkit, which you 
can integrate as discussed further above!)

That's all, except the warning that this method will not work with newer JPL ephemeris data, beyond DE421.


#### 2.b. Planets via JPL's `pleph` FORTRAN interface

To use the `jplint_` interface for planet ephemerides, you must either build superNOVAS with `BUILTIN_SOLSYS2 = 1` in 
`config.mk`, or else link your application with `solsys2.c` and `jplint.f` from SuperNOVAS explicitly (as well as 
`pleph.f` etc. from the JPL library). If you want the JPL `pleph`-based interface  to be your default ephemeris provider 
(the old way) you might also want to set `DEFAULT_SOLSYS = 2` in `config.mk`. Otherwise, your application should set 
your planetary ephemeris provider at runtime via:

```c
 set_planet_provider(planet_jplint);
 set_planet_provider_hp(planet_jplint_hp);
```

Integrating JPL ephemeris data this way can be arduous. You will need to compile and link FORTRAN with C (not the end
of the world), but you may also have to modify `jplint.f` to work with the version of `pleph.f` that you will be using.
Unless you already have code that relies on this method, you are probably better off choosing one of the other ways
for integrating planetary ephemeris data with SuperNOVAS.

<a name="explicit-ephem-linking"></a>
### 3. Explicit linking of custom ephemeris functions

Finally, if none of the above is appealing, and you are fond of the old ways, you may compile SuperNOVAS with the 
`DEFAULT_SOLSYS` option disabled (commented, removed, or else set to 0), and then link your own implemetation of
`solarsystem()` and `solarsystem_hp()` calls with your application. 

For Solar-system objects other than the major planets, you may also provide your own `readeph()` implementation. (In
this case you will want to set `DEFAULT_READEPH` in `config.mk` to specify your source code for that function before
building the SuperNOVAS library, or else disable that option entirely (e.g. by commenting or removing it), and link
your application explicitly with your `readeph()` implementation.

The downside of this approach is that your SuperNOVAS library will not be usable without invariably providing a
`solarsystem()` / `solarsystem_hp()` and/or `readeph()` implementations for _every_ application that you will want
to use SuperNOVAS with. This is why the runtime configuration of the ephemeris povider functions is the best and
most generic way to add your preferred implementations while also providing some minimum default implementations for
_other users_ of the library, who may not need _your_ ephemeris service, or have no need for planet data beyond the 
approximate positions for the Earth and Sun.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


<a name="release-schedule"></a>
## Release schedule

A predictable release schedule and process can help manage expectations and reduce stress on adopters and developers 
alike.

Releases of the library shall follow a quarterly release schedule. You may expect upcoming releases 
to be published around __March 1__, __June 1__, __September 1__, and/or __December 1__ each year, on an as needed
basis. That means that if there are outstanding bugs, or new pull requests (PRs), you may expect a release that 
addresses these in the upcoming quarter. The dates are placeholders only, with no guarantee that a release will 
actually be available every quarter. If nothing of note comes up, a potential release date may pass without a release 
being published.

_Feature releases_ (e.g. __1.x.0__ version bumps) are provided at least 6 months apart, to reduce stress on adopters 
who may need/want to tweak their code to integrate these. Between feature releases, _bug fix releases_ (without 
significant API changes) may be provided as needed to address issues. New features are generally reserved for the 
feature releases, although they may also be rolled out in bug-fix releases as long as they do not affect the existing 
API -- in line with the desire to keep bug-fix releases fully backwards compatible with their parent versions.

In the month(s) preceding releases one or more _release candidates_ (e.g. `1.0.1-rc3`) will be available on github
briefly, under [Releases](https://github.com/Smithsonian/SuperNOVAS/releases), so that changes can be tested by 
adopters before the releases are finalized. Please use due diligence to test such release candidates with your code 
when they become available to avoid unexpected surprises when the finalized release is published. Release candidates 
are typically available for one week only before they are superseded either by another, or by the finalized release.
